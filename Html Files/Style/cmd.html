      Drivers remain among the most important software installed on a PC. Improperly configured or missing drivers can cause all sorts of trouble, so its good to have access to a list of what’s on your PC. That’s exactly what the “driverquery” command does. You can extend it to “driverquery -v” to obtain more information including the directory in which the driver is installed.

">File compare</h1>

      This command can be used to identify differences in text between two files, and is particularly useful for writers and programmers trying to find small changes between two versions of a file. Simply type “fc” and then the directory path and file name of the two files you want to compare.

">fccmd</h1>

     You can also extend the command in several ways. Typing “/b” compares only binary output, “/c” disregards the case of text in the comparison, and “/l” only compares ASCII text.

So, for example, you could use the following:

fc /l "C:\Program Files (x86)\example1.doc" "C:\Program Files (x86)\example2.doc"

to compare ASCII text in two word documents.

">ipconfig</h1>
 
        This command relays the IP address that your computer is currently using. However, if you're behind a router (like most computers today), you'll instead receive the local network address of the router.

        Still, ipconfig is useful because of its extensions. "ipconfig /rekease" followed by "ipconfig/renew" can force your windows PC into asking for a new IP address, which is useful if your computer claims one isn't available. You can also use "ipconfig/flushdns"to refresh your DNS address. These commands are great if the Windows network troubleshooter chokes, which does happen on occasion.

">Netstat</h1>

     Entering the command "netstat -an" will provide you with a list of currently open ports and related IP addresses. You'll also be told what state the ports is in listening, established or closed. This is a great command if you're trying to troubleshoot the devices your PC is connected to or you're afraid you're infected with a Trojan and are trying to locate a malicious connected.
